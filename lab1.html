        <h1>Lab 1: The Artemis Board</h1>

        <h2>Background: Microcontrollers and the Artemis Board</h2>

        <p>Microcontrollers are an essential part of robotics; they act as the robot's interface to the world and its motherboard.
            In this class, we will be using the <a href ="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15443" target="_blank">SparkFun RedBoard Artemis Nano board</a> to implement various robotics projects. 
            Despite being small, lightweight, and inexpensive, it has some impressive features
            including Arduino IDE compatibility, 4 I2C buses, and 2 SPI buses. 
        </p>

        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>The purpose of Lab 1 was to get familiar with the Artemis board and the Arduino IDE by implementing examples included in __ libraries.
        </p>

        <h2>Examples</h2>
        <p>To run these examples, connect the Artemis board to a computer, typically through a USB-A or USB-C port.
            Upload the Arduino file to the board.
            For files that utilize the serial terminal, check that the terminal's baud rate matches the baud rate displayed in the setup() function. 

        </p>

        <h3>Blink It Up</h3>
        <p>This Arduino file blinks the blue LED on the Artemis board by turning it on and off periodically.
            This video shows LED blinking on the Artemis board.

        <h3>Serial</h3>
        <p>This Arduino file demonstrates how the serial monitor works. 
            Data is relayed through one of the Artemis' UART peripherals.
            In this example, a variable called count is incremented ten times and its value is printed to the serial monitor.
            After this task, the user can input a string and see it printed in the serial monitor.
            In this first image, the value of count in displayed. I also typed the word "hello" and it is printed below the values of count</p>

            <p>In this second image, I typed the word "goodbye" and it is printed on the next line under "hello."</p>
            <img src="./lab1_serial2.jpeg" alt="Serial Monitor Outputs the string Goodbye" width="240" height="320"/>

            <p>While sending strings across the Artemis' UART peripheral seems instantaneous to us, a serial print is a relatively expensive task.</p>
